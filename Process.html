                        <h4>Initial Design</h4>
                        <p>The initial design featured a simpler structure but lacked certain aerodynamic efficiencies and structural integrity. The fins were smaller, and the recovery system was not optimized for safety.</p>

                        <p>The final design improved on these aspects by incorporating larger, more stable fins, and a recovery system with a reliable parachute. The structural design also included enhanced materials for better durability.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Throughout the project, several errors were encountered. Initial tests revealed issues with stability and payload protection, which led to iterations on the design. Adjustments were made to improve the aerodynamic properties and ensure the safety of the payload during descent.</p>
